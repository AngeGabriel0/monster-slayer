## Description

In the game, you have the option to attack a monster, use a special attack, heal yourself, or abandon the fight. The player's and monster's life points are displayed on the screen.

## Game rules

1. At the start of the game, you choose your difficulty level: easy, medium, hard or impossible.
2. You and the monster start with a certain number of hit points, depending on the difficulty level chosen.
3. You can attack the monster, which reduces its health points.
4. You can also use a special attack, which deals more damage but can be used a limited number of times.
5. You can heal yourself, which increases your health points.
6. If you give up, the game ends and you lose.
7. The game ends when either player's life points reach zero.
